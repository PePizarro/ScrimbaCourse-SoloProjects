            <h3>
                How I stay committed to learning
            </h3>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
                simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
                share what I was learning and most things about my journey 
                with the world.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How I got started
            </h3>
            <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would 
                take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my
                notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and
                I realized that posting my learning 
                summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
            </p>
